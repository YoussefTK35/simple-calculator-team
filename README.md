### 🧮 Collaborative Calculator
A simple calculator project built with a focus on version control and team collaboration workflows.

### 🎯 The Goal
While the functionality is simple, the primary objective of this project was to master the "Git Flow." We used this project as a sandbox to practice:

- Feature Branching: Developing features in isolation.

- Pull Requests (PRs): Documenting changes and requesting reviews.

- Code Reviews: Peer-reviewing logic before merging into the main branch.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

- Version Control: Git & GitHub

### 👥 Contributors
This was a collaborative effort between:

- Youssef TAKI - [YoussefTK35](https://github.com/YoussefTK35/)

- Mouad OUCHELH - [Mouad_arr](https://github.com/Mouad-arr)

### 🚀 Key Takeaways
"The challenge wasn't the math logic; it was ensuring our collaborative workflow was seamless. Keeping the code simple allowed us to focus entirely on becoming proficient with Git."
